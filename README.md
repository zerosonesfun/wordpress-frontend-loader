# WordPress Frontend Loader
A minimal loading spinner plugin which uses very little code and uses a CSS only spinner. It works as soon as a link is clicked and keeps spinning until the new page is fully loaded. It spins for ajax requests too.

This plugin is brought to you by: SkyWolf, Billy Wilcosky, and donators like you! If this plugin helps you please buy me a coffee or two: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/billyw
