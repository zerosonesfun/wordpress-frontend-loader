## But, why jQuery?

jQuery will start to become smaller starting with version 4.0. jQuery is an easy way to work with Ajax; this is why a chunk of jQuery is used. Many WordPress plugins use jQuery.

## But, the spinner shows too much!

There are two sections at the beginning of the js file where you can add element selectors so that either click and/or Ajax related to those elements do not trigger the spinner.
