# WordPress Frontend Loader

![](https://github.com/zerosonesfun/wordpress-frontend-loader/blob/main/assets/banner-1544x500.png)

A loading spinner for WordPress which senses ajax requests, link clicks, and page loads. This gives your WordPress powered website native app-like power. It ignores the WordPress heartbeat because otherwise the spinner will pop up many times. A settings page lets you fine-tune when to ignore the loader.

## But, why jQuery?
jQuery will start to become smaller starting with version 4.0. jQuery is an easy way to work with Ajax; this is why a chunk of jQuery is used. Many WordPress plugins use jQuery; don't let people turn you off from it. It won't slow your site down especially if you implement the proper caching techniques.
