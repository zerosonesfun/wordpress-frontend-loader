A minimal loading spinner for WordPress that enhances your site with app-like loading behavior.

== Description ==

Frontend Loader is a WordPress plugin designed to add a sleek, minimal loading spinner to your website, offering an enhanced user experience reminiscent of native applications. It intelligently detects ajax requests, link clicks, and page loads to activate, excluding WordPress heartbeat actions to avoid unnecessary activations. A settings page provides a way to tell the plugin to ignore certain types of clicks and/or ajax requests based on CSS selectors (Classes or IDs).
